Table of Contents AI-metric definition Quantifying AI-metrics AI-metric definition Let‚Äôs say a chemical reaction can be one of $\\mathcal{C}$ classes, for ex., according to its type: ‚Äúcarboxylic acid to acid chloride‚Äù, ‚Äútranslocase-catalyzed‚Äù, etc.\nSome of these classes are sustainable, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$, some are not, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{non-sust}$, and we may have an unrecognized class, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{unrec}=\\{y_\\text{unrec}\\}$.\nClick to view the reaction type distribution In reality, our distribution of reaction types is hierarchical, but the argument still applies We can then quantify how likely we expect some reaction $\\pmb{x}$ to be of some class $y\\in\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ \\text{AI-metric}_y := \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\pmb{\\theta}\\vert\\mathcal{D})}\\left[p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}, \\pmb{\\theta})\\right]\\cdot\\text{confidence}(\\pmb{x}, y) \\quad \\in [0,1]$$ Where $\\pmb{\\theta}$ are the parameters of our AI model after training it on some dataset $\\mathcal{D}$.\nNote how we are scaling by how confident we are that this expected likelihood is correct. In our case,\n$$\\text{confidence}(\\pmb{x}, y) := 1 - 2\\cdot\\text{stddev}_{p(\\pmb{\\theta}\\vert\\mathcal{D})}\\big(p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}, \\pmb{\\theta})\\big)$$ Which is always in $[0,1]$ since probabilities cannot deviate more than $1/2$.\nBut, how do we score how likely our $\\pmb{x}$ is of any class in $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$?\nWe simply take the maximum over $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$:\n$$\\text{AI-metric} := \\max_{y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}} \\text{AI-metric}_y \\quad \\in [0, 1] $$ Why not sum over $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$? Formally, we are asking $p(\\cup_{\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}}y\\vert \\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D})$, which is: $$ \\max_{y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}} p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) \\leq p(\\cup_{\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}}y\\vert \\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) \\leq \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}} p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) $$ Since we are estimating our metric (see next section) and since some $\\pmb{x}$ may be of multiple classes, if we sum probabilities we would be overestimating the true value and also our score may end up above 1. It is also crucial that in our case our AI model is single-label, so it is designed to only predict the highest probability class. Quantifying AI-metrics Without getting too philosophical, we want to believe that for sure there is some underlying true classification set for an input $\\pmb{x}$, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{true} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$, so:\n$$ p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}) = \\begin{cases}1 \u0026amp; \\text{if }y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{true} \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text{o.w.}\\end{cases} $$ Note that (by our philosophy) $p(y\\vert\\pmb{x})$ is equivalent to $p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}_\\text{all})$ where $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{all}$ is all the knowledge of the universe (quite some information!).\nOf course, in reality at best we know:\n$$p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) = \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\pmb{\\theta}\\vert\\mathcal{D})}\\left[ p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\pmb{\\theta}) \\right]$$ For our observed training set $\\mathcal{D}$.\nThis introduces two sources of uncertainty:\nEpistemic $\\pmb{\\theta}$: due to the limited expresiveness of our model and its optimization procedure. We efficiently quantify it with Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout).\nAleatoric $\\mathcal{D}$: due to noise in our training set (some entries aren‚Äôt reactions or have a wrong label). We efficiently quantify it with test-time data augmentation.\n","date":1677339429,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677339429,"objectID":"bb373e34aa74a9e0f96d626986715a37","permalink":"https://sager611.github.io/project/epfl-master-thesis/","publishdate":"2023-02-25T16:37:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/epfl-master-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"What if we could systematically quantify how sustainable a reaction is?\nIn this project (my master‚Äôs thesis at EPFL) I explored how useful it would be if we quantified sustainability as how likely it is that a reaction is sustainable.","tags":["UQ","NLP","chemistry","sustainability"],"title":"UQ-based metrics for chemical sustainability","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
