Simply run passwd in your new machine.\nNow we setup ssh so it doesn’t ask for password when connecting to our new machine. In your old machine:\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_thinkpadp15.pub root@192.168.1.76 In my case it looks like:\n[root@thinkpad-t440s ~]$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.

Make sure to save a backup image. First, make sure you have enough space in your new hard disk. You can check this by running lsblk on your old and new machines.\nAlso make sure your hard disk in your new machine is unmounted with lsblk (MOUNTPOINTS should be empty).\nIn my case the hard disk in my new machine was nvme0n1. Make sure you choose the correct disk by looking at SIZE in lsblk. To avoid corrupting files during cloning, you should run the following command from another live USB in your old machine and make sure your hard drive sda is unmounted.\nRun the following in your old machine to clone the disk:\ndd if=/dev/sda | ssh root@192.168.1.76 dd of=/dev/nvme0n1 status=progress Change the IP, and sda and nvme0n1 according to your source and destination disk names.\nIt will take 20-25h to clone a 512GB SSD. Once it finishes, you will have copied all the contents from your old machine to your new machine, including GRUB and LUKS (also with logical volumes) if you had them setup.\nTroubleshooting boot and expanding LUKS partition If you cannot boot from your new disk then your GUID Partition Table (GPT) may be incorrect. This happens, for example, when the new disk is larger than the old one.\nIn my case my new disk is 1TB SSD, double the old disk. This is what I did to fix this issue. First, I ran:\nparted -l Which prompted me to fix the GPT from the disk. Simply type Fix and enter.\nThis is how my partition table looked like:\nModel: Micron MTFDKBA1T0TFH (nvme) Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 1024GB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B Partition Table: gpt Disk Flags: Number …","date":1678197067,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678197067,"objectID":"d42d1d3d5ad3291d8028253de88d2467","permalink":"https://sager611.github.io/post/clone-arch-disk/","publishdate":"2023-03-07T14:51:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/clone-arch-disk/","section":"post","summary":"I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 11 and wanted to migrate my whole hard drive contents from my old laptop with an Arch Linux installation.\nFollow this tutorial if you want to clone your old laptop’s hard drive to your new laptop’s hard drive via SSH in the same local network.","tags":[],"title":"Cloning Arch Linux hard disk remotely to new machine","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" In 2020 I was following lectures on automatic control and learned about the transfer function of a system and ways to visualize it, at which point I was curious so I went ahead and wrote a simple visualizer for generic transfer functions.\nYou can jump ahead to the visualizer.\nSetup The basic idea is that we can build a system with a feedback loop that takes an input signal $x(t)$ and outputs another signal $y(t)$:\nWe then focus on linear time-invariant (LTI) transformations, which in a few words are those which take as input $e(t)$ and output $y(t) = (e \\ast h)(t)$, where $h(t)$ is called the impulse response since it is exactly the value of the output $y(t)$ if our input where an impulse $e(t)=\\delta(t)$.\nIn the Laplace function space, the convolution of our transformation becomes a multiplication $Y(s) = H(s)E(s)$.\nLet’s plug in our $H(s)$ in the feedback loop!\nWe recursively apply it so we end up with:\n$$ \\begin{align*} Y(s) \u0026amp;= \\left( H(s) + H(s)^2 + H(s)^3 + \\dots \\right) \\cdot X(s) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{H(s)}{1 - H(s)} \\cdot X(s) \\end{align*} $$ Visualizer Note that if our $H(s)$ touches the value 1 we’ll end up with an $\\infty$, oops.\nSo, when designing $H(s)$ we want to make sure that it is some distance away from 1.\nBut $H: \\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, how can we visualize it?\nWell, there are multiple approaches and this is where I got curious and decided to write a visualizer in p5.js.

Table of Contents AI-metric definition Modelling uncertainty Quantifying AI-metrics Validating AI-metrics Don’t pay attention to the attention … Putting it all together AI-metric definition Let’s say a chemical reaction can be one of $\\mathcal{C}$ classes, for ex., according to its type: “carboxylic acid to acid chloride”, “translocase-catalyzed”, etc.\nSome of these classes are sustainable, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$, some are not, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{non-sust}$, and we may have an unrecognized class, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{unrec}=\\{y_\\text{unrec}\\}$.\nClick to view the reaction type distribution In reality, our distribution of reaction types is hierarchical, but the argument still applies We can then quantify how likely we expect some reaction $\\pmb{x}$ to be of some class $y\\in\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ \\text{AI-metric}_y := \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\pmb{\\theta}\\vert\\mathcal{D})}\\left[p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}, \\pmb{\\theta})\\right]\\cdot\\text{confidence}(\\pmb{x}, y) \\quad \\in [0,1]$$ Where $\\pmb{\\theta}$ are the parameters of our AI model after training it on some dataset $\\mathcal{D}$.\nNote how we are scaling by how confident we are that this expected likelihood is correct. In our case,\n$$\\text{confidence}(\\pmb{x}, y) := 1 - 2\\cdot\\text{stddev}_{p(\\pmb{\\theta}\\vert\\mathcal{D})}\\big(p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}, \\pmb{\\theta})\\big)$$ Which is always in $[0,1]$ since probabilities cannot deviate more than $1/2$.\nBut, how do we score how likely our $\\pmb{x}$ is of any class in $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$?\nWe simply take the maximum over $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$:\n$$\\text{AI-metric} := \\max_{y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}} \\text{AI-metric}_y \\quad \\in [0, 1] $$ Why not sum over $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}$? Formally, we are asking $p(\\cup_{\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}}y\\vert \\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D})$, which is: $$ \\max_{y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}} p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) \\leq p(\\cup_{\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}}y\\vert \\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) \\leq \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{sust}} p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) $$ Since we are estimating our metric (see next section) and since some $\\pmb{x}$ may be of multiple classes, if we sum probabilities we would be overestimating the true value and also our score may end up above 1. It is also crucial that in our case our AI model is single-label, so it is designed to only predict the highest probability class. Modelling uncertainty Without getting too philosophical, we want to believe that for sure there is some underlying true classification set for an input $\\pmb{x}$, $\\mathcal{C}_\\text{true} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$, so:\n$$ p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}) = \\begin{cases}1 \u0026amp; \\text{if }y\\in\\mathcal{C}_\\text{true} \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text{o.w.}\\end{cases} $$ Note that (by our philosophy) $p(y\\vert\\pmb{x})$ is equivalent to $p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}_\\text{all})$ where $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{all}$ is all the knowledge of the universe (quite some information!).\nOf course, in reality at best we know:\n$$p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\mathcal{D}) = \\mathbb{E}_{p(\\pmb{\\theta}\\vert\\mathcal{D})}\\left[ p(y\\vert\\pmb{x},\\pmb{\\theta}) \\right]$$ For our observed training set $\\mathcal{D}$.\nThis means that we are in the presence of two sources of uncertainty1:\nEpistemic $\\pmb{\\theta}$: due to the limited expresiveness of our model and its optimization procedure. Aleatoric $\\mathcal{D}$: due to noise in our training set (some entries aren’t reactions or have a wrong label). Quantifying AI-metrics We use efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to estimate our AI-metric according to the two sources of uncertainty2:\nMonte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout) for epistemic uncertainty $\\pmb{\\theta}$: We leave our Drouput layers on during inference, so for each forward pass on the same $\\pmb{x}$ we are effectively sampling different submodels from an ensemble.\nTest-time data augmentation for aleatoric uncertainty $\\mathcal{D}$: We augment $\\pmb{x}$ during inference.\nWe then have $N\\times M$ likelihoods $p(y\\vert\\pmb{x}^{(i)}, \\pmb{\\theta}^{(j)})$ where we sampled our input $\\pmb{x}^{(1)},\\dots,\\pmb{x}^{(N)}$ and our model $\\pmb{\\theta}^{(1)},\\dots,\\pmb{\\theta}^{(M)}$. Our AI-metric then simply uses the average and stddev of these values to compute its score.\nFor example,\nTop-5 reaction types for reaction according to the AI-metric.
